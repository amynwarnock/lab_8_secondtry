```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,
                      fig.width = 6.5,
                      fig.height = 8)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
```

```{r}
# Load the data

star <- read_csv(here("data", "star.csv"), show_col_types = FALSE)

```

In this lab, we will use the `tidyverse` (@tidyverse) and `here` (@here) packages. We will also use `reader` by @readr and `ggplot2` by @ggplot2, both of which load automatically with the `tidyverse` package.
